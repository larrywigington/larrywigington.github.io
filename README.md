## About Me

I'm a PhD student in Operations Research at the Naval Postgraduate School, where I focus on **GPU-accelerated optimization**, **numerical linear algebra**, and **distributed scientific computing**. My research sits at the intersection of computational mathematics and high-performance computing, with a goal of making large-scale optimization problems tractable through modern hardware acceleration.

Optimization isn't just about better answers — it's about better decisions, faster.
